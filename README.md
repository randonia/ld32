# An Unconventional Weapon #
![][20]  
Take aim and take them down before they take over the beach. Armed only with antacids you recover from downed gulls and a vine hook, take back the beach.

### Gameplay ###
Make your way across the dunes without getting stopped by a seagull or crab. Your only weapon: antacids. The only problem is, you have to get them out of the seagulls first. Hook a seagull to force it to crash land, blowing it up in the process. When a seagull crash lands, it will provide you with some ammo to take on the crabs. These things have been sitting in the seagull's stomachs for a while, so they're extremely volatile.

### Controls ###
* **A/D**: Move left and right
* **Space**: Jump
* **Left Mouse**: Charge up and throw Antacid (if you have any)
* **Right Mouse**: Sling vine (use this to take down seagulls to harvest antacids)
* **Left Shift**: Sprint (if not encumbered)

##### Acquiring Ammo #####
Additional Ammo is acquired by downing seagulls. You cannot get more ammo by hitting a seagull with an antacid, that sets off a chain reaction that detonates all of the ones inside as well.
